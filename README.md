  
This project demonstrates advanced usage of Redux, including action creators, thunks for asynchronous logic, and best practices for state management in React applications. The codebase includes:

- **Action Creators:** Functions that return action objects to describe state changes.
- **Thunks:** Middleware for handling asynchronous operations (such as API calls) before dispatching actions to the store.
- **Redux Store:** Centralized state management using reducers and middleware.
- **React Integration:** Connecting React components to the Redux store using hooks and the `react-redux` library.

Explore the `/src/store` and `/src/actions` directories for detailed implementations and examples.
